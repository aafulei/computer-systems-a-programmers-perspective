Practice Problem 2.38

As we will see in Chapter 3, the LEA instruction can perform computations of
the form (a << k) + b, where k is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and b is either 0 or
some program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform
multiplications by constant factors. For example, we can compute 3 * a as
(a << 1) + a.

Considering cases where b is either 0 or equal to a, and all possible values of
k, what multiples of a can be computed with a single LEA instruction?

Answer: a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 8a, 9a. For (a << k) + b,
              k     b
        -------------
        1a    0     a
        2a    1     0
        3a    1     a
        4a    2     0
        5a    2     a
        8a    3     0
        9a    3     a
