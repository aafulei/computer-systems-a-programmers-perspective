/* Homework Problem 2.60 (**) Suppose we number the bytes in a w-bit word from
0 (least significant) to w/8 - 1 (most significant). Writy code for the
following C function, which return an unsigned value in which_byte i of
argument x has been replaced by byte b: unsigned replace_byte~ (unsigned x,
'int i, unS'igne'd char b); ji' , -He~e are some examples showing how
theiunctidn should work: J,, v replace_byte(Ox12345678, 2, OxAB) -->
