Practice Problem 2.39

How could we modify the expression for form B for the case where bit position n
is the most significant bit?

Reference - for the expression x * K for some constant K

Form A: (x << n) + (x << (n - 1)) + ... + (x << m)
Form B: (x << (n + 1)) - (x << m)

Answer: In such case (x << (n + 1)) can be omitted and form B is simply
        -(x << m).
