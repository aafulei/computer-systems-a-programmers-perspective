Practice Problem 2.13

The Digital Equipment VAX computer was a very popular machine from the late
1970s until the late 1980s. Rather than instructions for Boolean AND and OR, it
had instructions bis (bit set) and bic (bit clear). Both instructions take a
data word x and a mask word m. They generate a result z consisting of the bits
of x modified according to the bits of m. With bis, the modification involves
setting z to 1 at each bit position where m is 1. With bic, the modification
involves setting z to 0 at each bit position where m is 1.

Fill in the missing code below.

/* Declarations of functions implementing operat~ons bis and bic */
int bis(int x, int m);
int bic(int x, int m);

/* Compute x | y using only calls to functions bis and bic */
int bool_or(int x, int y)
{
  int result = ________;
  return result;
}

/* Compute x ^ y using only calls to functions bis and bic */
int bool_xor(int x, int y)
{
  int result = ________;
  return result;
}


Answer:

/* Compute x | y using only calls to functions bis and bic */
int bool_or(int x, int y)
{
  int result = bis(x, y);
  return result;
}

/* Compute x ^ y using only calls to functions bis and bic */
int bool_xor(int x, int y)
{
  int result = bis(bic(x, y), bic(y, x));
  return result;
}
