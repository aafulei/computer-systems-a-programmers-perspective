Practice Problem 2.41

For a run of ones starting a bit position n down to bit position m (n >= m), we
saw that we can gerneate two forms of code, A and B. How should the copmiler
decide which form to use.

Answer: Assuming addition and subtraction have the same cost, form B is always
beter than form A except when n == m, where form A is better, and when
n == m + 1, where two forms have the same cost.
