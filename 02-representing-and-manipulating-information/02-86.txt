Homework Problem 2.86 (*)

Intel-compatible processors also support an "extended-precision" floating-point
format with an 80-bit word divided into a sign bit, k = 15 exponent bits, a
single integer bit, and n = 63 fraction bits. The integer bit is an explicit
copy of the implied bit in the IEEE floating-point representation. That is, it
equals 1 for normalized values and 0 for denomalized values. Fill in the
following table giving the approximate values of some "interesting" numbers in
this format:

                                  Extended precision
                                  ------------------
Description                       Value      Decimal
----------------------------------------------------
Smallest positive denormalized
Smallest positive normalized
Largest normalized

This format can be used in C programs compiled for Intel-compatible machines by
declaring the data to be of type long double. However, it forces the compiler
to generate code based on the legacy 8087 floating-point instructions. The
resulting program will most likely run much slower than would be the case for
data type float or double.

Answer:


                                  Extended precision
                                  ------------------
Description                       Value      Decimal
----------------------------------------------------
Smallest positive denormalized
Smallest positive normalized
Largest normalized
