Practice Problem 2.9

Computers generate color pictures on a video screen or liquid crstal display
by mixing three different colors of light: red, green, and blue. Imagine a
simple scheme, with three different lights, each of which can be turned on or
off, projecting onto a glass screen:

Light sources   Glass screen

         Red         |
            \        |
             \       |
      Green --       |          * (Observer)
             /       |
            /        |
        Blue         |

Each of these colors can be represented as a bit vector of length 3, and we can
apply Boolean operations to theme.

R    G    B    Color
--------------------
0    0    0    Black
0    0    1    Blue
0    1    0    Green
0    1    1    Cyan
1    0    0    Red
1    0    1    Magenta
1    1    0    Yellow
1    1    1    White

A. The complement of a color is formed by turning off the lights that are on
   and turning on the lights that are off. What would be the complement of each
   of the eight colors listed above?

B. Describe the effect of applying Boolean operations on the following colors:

   Blue | Green = ________
   Yellow & Cyan = ________
   Red ^ Magenta = ________


Answer:

(A)

R    G    B    Color      Complement
------------------------------------
0    0    0    Black      White
0    0    1    Blue       Yellow
0    1    0    Green      Magenta
0    1    1    Cyan       Red
1    0    0    Red        Cyan
1    0    1    Magenta    Green
1    1    0    Yellow     Blue
1    1    1    White      Black


(B)

Blue | Green = (001) | (010) = 011 = Cyan
Yellow & Cyan = (110) & (011) = 010 = Green
Red ^ Magenta = (100) ^ (101) = 001 = Blue
